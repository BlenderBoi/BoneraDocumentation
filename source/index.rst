Welcome to Bonera's documentation!
==================================

Bonera is a Blender Addon that adds semi auto tool to help you in your rigging process. Instead of a full blown rigging system, Bonera's goal is to add the "wrench and screwdriver" of your rigging process, aiming to speed up the tedious part of the manual rigging process
